This GitHub repository accompanies all my YouTube videos. My goal is simple: to share not only the final content but also the thought process behind it.

My videos are not fixed truths, but documented explorations. This repository exists to reveal the behind-the-scenes, encourage constructive criticism, and contribute to a more honest and rigorous ecosystem.

# Transparency

In a world saturated with information, value doesn‚Äôt just come from what we claim, but also from how we arrive at it. That‚Äôs why I make public:

- the code I use to collect and process my data
- my sources and inspirations
- the production tools I use (scraping, editing, design)
- my cognitive biases and initial beliefs
- my critiques and contextualization of the statistics I present

This transparency is not meant to deliver absolute truth, but to allow everyone to understand my choices, question them, and even reproduce or challenge my analyses.

# Generative Artificial Intelligence

AI is also part of my process. I use it as a thinking assistant (structuring, brainstorming, reformulation), but never to draw conclusions for me.

# Chain of Trust

Finally, I strive to build a real chain of trust around my videos. Some sources are rich in insights but remain partial or biased. Statistics are therefore always put back into context and never used without nuance.
