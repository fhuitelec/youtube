## Use of AI

üëâ For this video, **AI played a significant role**.

- I used **Cursor (Claude Sonnet 4)** to:
  - co-create a CLI for competitor analysis to extract precise statistics from adjacent/competing YouTube channels
- I used **ChatGPT (GPT-5)** to:
  - understand the YouTube API for competitor research
  - study market trends (source-backed approach)
  - generate the NodeJS script [devops-labor-market-trends](./code/devops-labor-market-trends/) to pull data from the [Hacker News Algolia API](https://hn.algolia.com/api)
  - help me pick the theme and title of the video from competitor/adjacent YouTube channel statistics
  - generate a draft video script structure
  - refine the video script
- **I did not use AI for**:
  - the overall approach of the video
  - the writing of the first draft of the script

## Inspirations & references

### Main inspiration

[DevOps Jobs Are Disappearing - Here's Why You Should Celebrate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1X9xefE0Q) by [Mischa van den Burg](https://www.youtube.com/@mischavandenburg):

- this was my main source of inspiration for the idea and hook of the video: I largely followed by imitation
- some similarities can be seen in the motion design and a few structural elements
- beyond the hook, I did not draw from the rest of his video and diverge completely after [01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnExltM4yII&t=100s)

## My cognitive biases

### Starting beliefs

- The job of ‚ÄúDevOps‚Äù is a market ‚Äúaberration‚Äù; it is primarily a culture, not a job title
- The roles and functions behind the ‚ÄúDevOps engineer‚Äù label have been fragmenting into several key roles (SRE, Platform, Cloud, Security, Software engineers) since ~2017

### Associated biases

- Confirmation bias: I don‚Äôt think I managed to overcome it, it shows in my use of Hacker News data
- Identity bias: I have lived in the ecosystem I describe for 11+ years, so I‚Äôm not objective

## Statistics & interpretation

### Visualizations

- [1]<a name=visualisation-1></a> [00:03](https://youtu.be/VnExltM4yII?t=3): [DevOps declining - HN - Who is hiring](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/24897779/)
- [2]<a name=visualisation-2></a> [00:14](https://youtu.be/VnExltM4yII?t=14): [New roles - HN - Who is hiring](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/24898238/)
- [3]<a name=visualisation-3></a> [03:00](https://youtu.be/VnExltM4yII?t=180): [DevOps vs Platform vs SRE - HN - Who is hiring](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/24855770/)

### Source niche

The Hacker News ‚ÄúWho is Hiring‚Äù job postings are not representative of:

- the broader English-speaking tech job market
- and even less of the French market

### Specific context

The tech job market has been disrupted since ~2020:
  - during the Covid crisis, the market experienced extraordinary growth
  - between 2022 and 2024, the market went through a correction with significant decline (waves of layoffs, hiring freezes, etc.)
  - since 2025, some balance is starting to return

### Criticism

This means that the drop in *job postings* for the role of ‚ÄúDevOps engineer‚Äù [[1](#visualisation-1)] cannot only be attributed to the trend I try to highlight.  

Due to the shrinking sample size caused by market conditions, it‚Äôs even possible that graphs [[2](#visualisation-2)] & [[3](#visualisation-3)] are driven primarily by those market conditions rather than the trend I attempt to show in the video.

## Self-critique

- the subject is covered very superficially; 7 minutes is short
- the analogy with the webmaster role is somewhat relatable, but feels a bit shaky
