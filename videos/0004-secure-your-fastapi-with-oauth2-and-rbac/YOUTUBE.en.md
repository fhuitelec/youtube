## Use of AI

üëâ For this video, **AI had a very low footprint**.

- I used **ChatGPT (GPT-5)** to:
  - help me find the video title and thumbnail
  - generate the structure for the intro and outro scripts
  - generate the OAuth2 "Authorization code" flow Mermaid diagram
- I used **GitHub Copilot (GPT-4.1 Copilot)** to:
  - occasionally autocomplete some code (visible in the video)

## Self-Review

- I initially wanted to fit everything into 15 minutes ‚Äî impossible to include both theory and practice, even with tight editing
- The hands-on part ended up being very guided ‚Äî more ‚Äúexplained code‚Äù than ‚Äúcode with me‚Äù
- I skipped several deeper OAuth2 topics:
  - true delegated authorization using scopes
  - reasoning around access token lifespan
  - user sessions and refresh tokens
  - sensitive actions with short token validity
  - invalidation and trade-offs
- I also approached this episode poorly at first:
  - I created way too much material before realizing it was too dense
  - I eventually had to cut 40‚Äì50% of what I prepared to make it fit the format
